# SOLID-Principle

**Description:** <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This repository aims to enhance the existing codebase by applying the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). The SOLID principles provide guidelines for designing maintainable, scalable, and understandable software systems. In this context, the codebase is refactored to adhere to these principles, ensuring better code organization, flexibility, and extensibility. <br>

**UML Class Diagram:** <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The UML class diagram illustrates the relationships between the classes and interfaces involved in the solution. It demonstrates how the classes adhere to SOLID principles and interact with each other to fulfill the requirements of the system. <br>
